          <p>We're exploiting the <a href ="https://www.nature.com/subjects/sers" >SERS</a> phenomenon in the detection of target molecules present in concentrations as small as in the nanomolar range. During the first phase of the project, I learnt how to synthesise gold nanoparticles and gold nanorods, as well as verify that they were indeed what I wanted to synthesise.</p>
