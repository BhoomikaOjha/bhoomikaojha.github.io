            <p>For my thesis, I am working with Professor Arun Chattopadhyay from the Department of Chemistry, IIT Guwahati.</p><br><br>

          <br>Advancements in the field of applied science and technology have always gone hand-in-hand with the development of new spectroscopic techniques. Much like its predecessors, <a href ="https://www.nature.com/subjects/sers" style="color:#4F1767 ;">Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</a> has been a tool of great significance in the detection and probing of various molecules and moieties since its inception in 1977. More recently, it has allowed for detection of target compounds in extremely small concentrations; as small as in the nanomolar range. In addition to this, SERS has also paved the path for developmental studies in chemical hotspot engineering. We're exploiting the SERS phenomenon in the detection of a target molecule present in varying concentrations - millimolar, micromolar and nanomolar ranges, and studying the enhancement of the characteristic Raman signals in each case.
          <br> During the first phase of the project, I learnt how to synthesise gold nanoparticles and gold nanorods, as well as verify that they were indeed what I wanted to synthesise. Following that, we tested the chemisorption of the target molecule on the surface of these nanoparticles.
          <br>Our resutls were in line with what we expeced to see. In the next phase, we've decided to carry out a set of 12 controlled experiments by tweaking the current process to use different geometries and different assemblies of nanoscale structures, and employ a change of solvents.
