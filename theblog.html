            <h2>Moving the blog</h2>
            <p>I attempted hosting a blog back when I was 19 years old.</p><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>I wasn't the most dedicated to it back then, but off late I haven't been able to contain the overflowing amounts of writing prompts. During my time in college, I've formed some opinions and changed some. I've accepted some beliefs and outright rejected some. Gained lots of weight and then lost some - you get the picture. </p>
          <p>Not every story may be worth sharing, but I think it's a good idea to share those few that are.</p>
